        Summer is the time to have outdoor fun with our dogs. Longer walks in the park, ambitious hikes, beach days, or family travel the sun is shining, and the outdoors is calling. 
        But hot weather can also make us uncomfortable, and it poses special risks for dogs. From an increased exposure to ticks and other insects, to sunburn, and even heatstroke, all sorts of things can go wrong for your dog in summer. Keep the following safety concerns in mind as the temperature rises, and follow our tips for summer safety for dogs. 
        They will help you keep your pet happier and healthier during the dog days of summer.
        However, longer daytime hours and warmer temperatures bring hazards along with them. Be aware of those summer hazards so that you can enjoy a carefree and safe summer with your best friend!
   
Stay alert for signs of exhaustion or heat stroke. If your dog is extremely lethargic, pants excessively, shows signs of diarrhoea and disorientation, take immediate steps to cool him down and get him to a vet immediately.
While walking outdoors, choose grassy and shaded routes. Walking on hot pavements, especially asphalt, can cause blisters on your dog’s paws. Make sure to never leave your dog locked in a vehicle as it can get a heat stroke within minutes. Light-coloured and thinly coated dogs are prone to sunburn and must use waterproof sunscreen.

    <p id="second"> <i>Most apartment dogs will seek out cool spots such as batches of bare tiled floor, corners, under table areas etc. Allow your dog easy access to these spots by keeping them free of furniture. Place their bedding, water and feeding bowls there. Cotton sheet bedding will keep your dog cool. However, most will prefer lying on the floor during summer.
        If you have lots of large windows at home, shade them with blinds, curtains and sun-shades. This way your dog can enjoy the breeze while avoiding the heat. Placing plants by the windows will also help keep your home cool.
        Air-conditioning is a good option for many dog breeds. Huskies and Saint Bernards tend to overheat easily. Same goes for snub-nosed dogs like pugs and bulldogs who have comparatively small respiratory tracts, making it difficult for them to release heat by panting.
        Long-haired dogs like Pomeranians and Golden Retrievers can be kept cool by trimming their fur. This also reduces the risk of bacteria and parasites. Consult your vet or groomer so your don’t overdo trimming.
        One of the most important aspects of dog care in summer is diet modification. Switch to wet food such as beef broth and ice cubes to increase their fluid intake. Frozen chicken and cucumber slices will also help keep your dog cool. Refill water bowls around the house frequently.
        Dogs get thirstier than us when it gets hot. Remember to carry a bottle of water, ice packs and wet towels every time you’re out for extended periods of time. This is especially important for older dogs or breeds that are susceptible to heat stroke.
